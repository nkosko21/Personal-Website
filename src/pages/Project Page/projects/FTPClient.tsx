            I developed an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client in Python to facilitate easy and secure file transfer between a local machine and a remote server. 
            The client supports standard FTP commands, such as uploading, downloading, deleting, and listing files on the server. 
            It also includes features for managing multiple connections and handling errors gracefully. 
            This project was aimed at providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with FTP servers and improving file management efficiency.
