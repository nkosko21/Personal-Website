            In this project, I've developed a simple BGP router, aiming to provide hands-on experience with core internet infrastructure functionalities. 
            By constructing and managing forwarding tables, generating route announcements, and forwarding data packets from internet users, the project 
            offers insight into the inner workings of internet backbone infrastructure. Additionally, it enhances proficiency in IP address manipulation, emphasizing 
            subnet mask notation and network masks' significance. Utilizing the select() and poll() API functions further enhances the understanding of managing multiple sockets within a single program. 
            Within the provided simulator environment, the BGP router accomplishes essential functions akin to real routers, including accepting route announcements, generating new routes, 
            compressing forwarding tables, and efficiently forwarding data packets from simulated internet users.
